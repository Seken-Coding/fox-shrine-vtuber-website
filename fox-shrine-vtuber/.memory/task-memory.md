# Task Memory: Dark Mode Toggle Implementation

## Task Overview
- **Type**: Feature Implementation
- **Objective**: Create persistent dark mode toggle for all pages
- **Date**: September 17, 2025

## Current Context
- React + Create React App architecture
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom shrine theme
- Framer Motion animations implemented across all pages
- User has manually edited package.json (need to check changes)

## Implementation Plan
1. Check current package.json changes
2. Research dark mode best practices with Context7
3. Create ThemeContext for state management
4. Implement persistent storage with localStorage
5. Create dark mode toggle component
6. Update Tailwind config for dark mode
7. Apply dark mode styles across all pages
8. Test persistence and functionality

## Technical Requirements
- Context API for theme state
- localStorage for persistence
- Tailwind dark: variants
- Smooth transitions between modes
- Accessible toggle component
- Integration with existing Framer Motion animations

## Progress Log
- **2025-09-29:** Researched Jest and Supertest guidance via Context7 for Express modular routers; attempted supplemental Google search for best practices (Google request blocked by fetch tool). Planning backend integration tests next.
- **2025-09-29:** Reviewed modular Express structure (routers + middleware). Strategy: build test-only Express app wiring target routers, mock `db` module to supply faux pool responses, and stub auth middleware to avoid JWT/SQL dependencies.
- **2025-09-29:** Wired API package for Jest + Supertest (updated package.json scripts/deps, added jest.config.js, shared test helpers and setup file).
- **2025-09-29:** Added health/auth/config route tests with Supertest + mocked DB/auth utilities to validate success paths and permission-gated updates.
- **2025-09-29:** Refined config route tests with partial auth mocking to preserve permission logic, added unauthorized update coverage, and achieved a fully passing Jest backend suite.
- **2025-09-29:** Expanded config route suite to cover category fetch, bulk update success and validation failure, and delete success/404 branches while keeping the Supertest run green.
